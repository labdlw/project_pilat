# Wet Meadow Connectivity Project

This repository contains the code, processed data, and documentation for the project:
**"Ecological measures of connectivity confirmed by a genetic analysis of gene flow"**.

We studied ecological and genetic connectivity in three plant species (Oenanthe peucedanifolia, Scorzonera humilis, and Lychnis flos-cuculi) across floodplain meadows in southeastern France. Methods include RADseq population genomics, species distribution modeling (SDM), landscape resistance modeling (Graphab), and genome-environment association (GEMMA).

## Repository structure

- `data/`: Clean input datasets (VCFs, metadata, habitat maps).
- `scripts/`: R and bash scripts for analysis (RADseq, SDM, connectivity).
- `results/`: Output plots and tables.
- `manuscript/`: Manuscript draft and submission materials.
- `docs/`: Reference files, citation data, and supporting materials.
