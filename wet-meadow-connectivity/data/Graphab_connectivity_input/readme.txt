This folder contains the input files to run the program Graphab. 
This program takes as input a resistance map and a suitable habitat map for each of the species.
From these files it can output various connectivity metrics. These input files are generated thanks to Maxent. 
The suitable habitat map is calculated from the value given by the species distribution model in Maxent called "Maximum training sensitivity plus specificity Cloglog threshold".

The rest of the input files are located here (too big to be uploaded on github) "/home/alle/Documents/Pilat_project/Lisa_Graphab_25012024/wetransfer_lfloscuculi_graphab_ok_int_cvbe5-tif_2024-01-25_1603".
